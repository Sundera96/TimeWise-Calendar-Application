The application backend uses 3 services:
- **Event Service**
- **Security Service (Spring Security)**
- **Gateway Service (Spring Cloud Gateway)**

All services are developed using Spring Boot and deployed as containers in Google Cloud. The frontend of the application uses React and Vite for deployment, also containerized and hosted in Google Cloud.
